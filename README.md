## OverView
The goal of this project is to classify images using the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. MobileNetV2 is a lightweight deep learning model, efficient for mobile and embedded vision applications. The model is trained on the ImageNet dataset, which includes a wide range of objects and scenes. The project fetches an image from a URL, preprocesses it, and makes a classification prediction, displaying the top predicted categories.

## Techniques Covered
- MobileNetV2: Pre-trained deep learning model for image classification.
- Image Preprocessing: Resizing and normalizing images to fit the modelâ€™s input requirements.
- Prediction: Using the model to predict the image's class based on ImageNet's 1,000 classes.
- TensorFlow/Keras: Frameworks used to load the model and perform inference.

## Features
- Image URL Input: Allows users to input an image URL for classification.
- Pre-trained Model: Utilizes MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet for object classification.
- Top N Predictions: Displays the top 3 predicted labels with their confidence scores.
- Matplotlib Visualization: Displays the input image with predicted labels.

## Usage
- Fetch Image from URL: Input an image URL, and the image will be fetched from the web.
- Preprocess Image: Resize and normalize the image to fit the MobileNetV2 model input.
- Classify the Image: Use MobileNetV2 to classify the image and return the top 3 predicted labels.
- Display Results: Show the image with the predicted labels and confidence scores.

## Step-by-step
- Enter the Image URL: Provide the image URL for the model to classify.
- Preprocess the Image: The image is resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized.
- Model Classification: The MobileNetV2 model is used to predict the top 3 classes for the image.
- Display Results: The image and the top 3 predicted classes are displayed.

## Dependencies
```
